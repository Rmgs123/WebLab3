This is a team website development project using _Django_

## **Our Idea:**
We are going to make a **Telegram-like** website where people will communicate via private messages or in public chat groups. But it will be with one particular ~feature~... - It will be for girls

## **Current Functionality:**
- Registration and Login
- Account Managment
- Adding users
- Chatting (with .png or .jpg upload)
- Notifications on new messages
- *Responsive Web Desing
- and etc...

## **Current Design:**
