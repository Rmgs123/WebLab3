This is a _Django_ team website development project

## **Our Idea:**
We are going to make a **Telegram-like** website where people will communicate via private messages or in public blogs (groups). And it will be with one particular ~feature~...

## **Current Functionality:**
- Registration and Login
- Account Managment
- Adding users (friends)
- Chatting (with .png or .jpg upload)
- Notifications (on new messages)
- Blog creation and managment
- Responsive Web Desing
- and etc...

## **Hosting:**
If currently hosted, website will be available via:
- _https://girlhub.onrender.com/_
